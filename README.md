# Game Backlog Generator

game-bklg-gen is a Python cli that helps you to create and randomize a list of games to help you get rid of your game backlog.

It uses an randomize algorithm to identify and prioritize games by their identifier number.

For example Castlevania 2 and Castlevania 3, will prioritize Castlevania 2 first on generation.
